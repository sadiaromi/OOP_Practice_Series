# 🧠📘 Mastering OOP in Python: A Practical Assignment Series

Welcome to the Complete OOP Practice Series in Python — a comprehensive repository of hands-on Python assignments designed to help you Build, Compose, and Decorate using Object-Oriented Programming.

Whether you're just starting your journey into OOP or revising key concepts, this curated set of tasks and examples gives you a complete, structured learning experience. Each assignment targets a specific OOP concept, combining code with practical understanding.

🧩 Topics Covered

📝 Fundamental Concepts

1. self Keyword

Learn how to initialize instance variables inside a class constructor.

2. cls Keyword

Understand class methods and how class-level data is managed.

3. Public Variables and Methods

Use public members and access them outside the class.

4. Class Variables and Class Methods

Share data across all instances using class-level members.

5. Static Methods

Implement utility logic unrelated to class or instance variables.

🏗️ Object Lifecycle

6. Constructors and Destructors

Define what happens when an object is created and destroyed.

🔐 Access Control

7. Public, Protected, and Private Variables

Understand attribute visibility using naming conventions.

🧬 Inheritance and Structure

8. super() Function

Call parent class constructor in child class.

9. Abstract Classes

Use abc module to create abstract methods.

🧠 Instance-Level Behavior

10. Instance Methods

Use object methods that act on instance variables.

11. Property Decorators

Control access using @property, @setter, and @deleter.

⚙️ Design Principles

12. Composition

Include one class object inside another.

13. Aggregation

Pass an already existing object into another class.

14. Callable Objects

Make class instances behave like functions using __call__().

15. Custom Exceptions

Raise your own error types.

16. Iterable Classes

Use __iter__() and __next__() to create a custom iterable.

📦 Extras

17. Temperature Converter

Practice static methods for real-world utility.

18. Book Counter

Use class variables to track shared information.


▶ How to Run

Each assignment is saved in its own Python file:

python filename.py

🎯 Objective

Build a strong foundation in Python's object-oriented features.Apply theoretical knowledge through practical coding tasks.Understand advanced OOP concepts like decorators, MRO, and abstract base classes.Improve code organization and reusability
